  - Your site is now running with hot reloading at `http://localhost:8000`!

  - Query data through `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.

- `yarn storybook`

  - Storybook is running to view individual components at `http://localhost:6006`

### Tips

- To get a sitemap, enter the URL of any nonexisting page. http://localhost:8000/asdf
- Design files are on Figma. https://www.figma.com/files/project/3988002/vanhelbergen.com

## 💫 Deploy

- `yarn build`

  - Run the production build to check there are no errors. You can check a deploy preview
    for your branch on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/vanhelbergen-com/deploys?filter=deploy+previews).

  - Once the branch gets merged to master, Netlify deploys automatically to https://vanhelbergen-com.netlify.com/.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    /.
    ├── /.storybook
    ├── /src
        ├── /components
        ├── /content
        ├── /images
        ├── /pages
        ├── /templates
        └── /theme
    ├── /static
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    └── gatsby-ssr.js

### Folders

1.  **`/.storybook`**: Storybook configuration files.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template. “Src” is a convention for “source code”.

    1.  **`__stories__`**: Stories for all non-component type things. Otherwise stories are kept next to the components in the `components` folder.

    1.  **`/components`**: React components for across the site.


    1.  **`/content`**: Markdown and MDX files for blogs and portfolio entries. Assets for entries should be included withing this folders.

    1.  **`/images`**: Assets that need to be dynamically included in random places, e.g. global styles, and the home logo.

    1.  **`/pages`**: Components under src/pages become pages automatically with paths based on their file name. Check out the pages docs for more detail.

    1.  **`/templates`**: By convention, templates used across multiple pages are stored here. Contains templates for programmatically creating pages. Check out the templates docs for more detail.

    1.  **`/theme`**: Contains all over-arching style files (styles for components are stored with their components). Not to be confused with Gatsby Themes.

1.  **`/static`**: If you put a file into the static folder, it will not be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the public folder untouched. Check out the assets docs for more detail.

### Autogenerated folders

1.  **`/.cache`** This folder is an internal cache created automatically by Gatsby from. The files inside this folder are not meant for modification. Should be .gitignore-d.

1.  **`/public`** The output of `gatsby build` process will be exposed inside this folder. Should be .gitignore-d.

### Files

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

1.  **`src/html.js`** Add it for custom configuration of default .cache/default_html.js. Check out the custom html docs for more detail.

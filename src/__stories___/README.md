# Why is this folder here?

Stories are generally kept with their components. However this isn't always possible.

- Atomic design elements, like `<b>`, don't have components to be kept with.
- Gatsby components, like `pages`, break when there are files other than pages in their folder.

The stories for all these elements are kept here.

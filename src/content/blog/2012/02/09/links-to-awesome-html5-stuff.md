Although this may be old news to most of you, I find that a lot of people still haven’t seen most of these. If your new to HTML5 or not convinced of its power or for whatever reason don’t think it’s ‘AWESOME!!!’ (note the three exclamation marks, it’s that awesome), then check out these resources below to be convinced.

## Overview with Google IO

This is one of the best overview presentations that I have found out there. The great thing is, is that the actual live presentation was taped and is available on YouTube. So open both simultaneously and play with the presentation and the code while someone explains what it is.

## In Depth Info with these Encyclopedias

For some more depth and to get your hands dirty the following two links are super useful.

- [html5rocks.com](http://www.html5rocks.com/) - Evangelises HTML5 has apresentations, samples and tutorials. Especially the slides with the [HTML5 Presentation](http://slides.html5rocks.com/#landing-slide) give a nice overview.
- [diveintohtml5.info](http://diveintohtml5.info/) – A super good read and useful as a more in depth tutorial. Continuation of Mark Pilgrims project.

## Showcases that give Proof of Awesome

The following are some of the nicest projects that I’ve seen using HTML5 to the fullest. To be fair they’re just so cool because they use WebGL which in itself goes a lot further than HTML5, but still…

- [chromeexperiments.com](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/) – a collection of ‘small’ experiments showing the really nifty stuff you can do.
- [ro.me](http://www.ro.me/) – An interactive music video for Norah Jones.
- [lights.elliegoulding.com](http://lights.elliegoulding.com/) – Another music video (do you they’re all going to do this from now on?), this time for Ellie Goulding.

Enjoy!

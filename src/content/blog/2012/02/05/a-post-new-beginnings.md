## The Incentive

After my good friend Arthur had updated his [personal website](http://www.artjulian.nl/) a while back and then started his [own blog](http://loremawesum.com/ˀ) as well, I was just a little bit envious (Great domainname, btw!). But when two seperate managers told me I was definitely lacking by not showcasing my work properly, I knew it’s about time I got my act together.

For that matter, it’s only been years since I wanted to have a proper web-based portfolio and somewhere to show the world what I fill my time with. I wanted a CMS to do the heavy-lifting for me because I wanted something sooner rather than later. I’ve worked with Joomla and Mambo in the past but they always seemed to be a bit rigid and lacking, so I decided to go with a new WordPress installation.

## Thanks to the guys who made it all possible

So, to kick-start all of this, I would like to thank the wonderful people at [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) for their great product. I corrupted my whole install about 4 or five times trying to get everything working and had to start over again, but I blame that on the sub-par plug-in implementations (of which I of course had to try lots and lots ;) ).

The following is the set-up that I stuck with in the end.

- [Simple Portfolio](http://projects.inlet.nl/simple-portfolio-wordpress3/), this seemed like the most blank portfolio plug-in I could find. So I’m hoping I’ll figure out how to optimise it in the future.
- [WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/), this has been praised in so many different places, I thought it was about time I try it out. So far it seems like a good bet.
- [Roots Theme](http://www.rootstheme.com/), I wanted something that was HTML5 and responsive, this has that. Haven’t checked out if everything works the way it should but at least I’ve got something going.

Right. So that’s that. Now let’s hope it holds up long enough for me to actually get some useful content online.
